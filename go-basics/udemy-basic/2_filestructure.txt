In Go workspace contains three subdirectories at its root:

src – This directory contains source files organized as packages. You will write your Go applications inside this directory.
pkg – This directory contains Go package objects.
bin – This directory contains executable programs.

// a typical go project has a main directory called go with three subdirectries
/go
	// your source code should be in src directory
	/src
		your-source-code-here
	// all compiled binaries are gone in bin folders
	/bin
		compiler binary-1
		compiler binary -2
	// all intermediate package are gone here..
	// which are needed to build a final package.
	/pkg
		objects to be linked
		external dependencies goes here


// Go compilar has a function called linker
// every times you compiler your source code its look between then package folder 
and looking for pre-requisits and combine them and create a self contained binary file
